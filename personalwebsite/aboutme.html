            <h1>Hey,</h1>

            <p><em>my name's John. I developed this personal
                website so you can get to know more about me, my interests, and the work I have done.</em></p>
            <p>A little about me: I am 100% Filipino and 100% New Yorker. I was born in Queens, but raised in the Bronx.
                I went to private school up until college. I liked to play basketball and skate when I was younger.
                Now, I enjoy going to new places, trying new foods and educating myself.
            </p>
            <p>I graduated from Stony Brook University (class of 2016) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
                Science. A couple of things I took from higher education is the true value of knowledge  and the importance
                of work ethic.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">My goal</h2>
            <p>I aim to build my professional career and apply my skills as a programmer/software developer.</p>
